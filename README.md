# NumbersApi

## Information

This is my first project coding Typescript together with AJAX. 

The API I have selected is the Numbers API (http://numbersapi.com/#42) which allows the user to send their input on a selected number they would like to see interesting facts about. My goal is to build a functional website that sends a query to an open API and displays the response using fetch and DOM manipulation.
